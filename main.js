//    You will know you did this properly when you open the 
//    index.html page in a browser and see the alert message.



// 3. Display your name into the Console (and then find the console within the browser).

//    Find the the name within the console in TWO locations: 
//     - a) Find the console within the CodePen layout.
//     - b) Find the console within the browser.
